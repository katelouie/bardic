You draw three cards from the deck...

@render card_spread(cards, layout='three_card')

The first card is {cards[0].name}.

@render card_detail(cards[0], position='past')

+ [Continue] -> Interpret

:: Interpret
~ interpretation = "positive"

**Interpretation**

@render interpretation_panel(cards, interpretation)

The cards suggest a journey of discovery.

+ [Draw again] -> Start
+ [End reading] -> End
