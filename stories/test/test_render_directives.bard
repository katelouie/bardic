@render:react card_spread(cards=cards, layout='three_card')

The first card is {cards[0].name}.

@render:react card_detail(card=cards[0], position='past')

+ [Continue] -> Interpret

:: Interpret
~ interpretation = "positive"

@render:react interpretation_panel(interpretation=interpretation)

The cards suggest a journey of discovery.

+ [Draw again] -> Start
