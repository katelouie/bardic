:: Start
~ count = 0
~ health = 100
~ multiplier = 2
~ price = 100.0

Basic increment:
~ count += 1
Count is now {count}

Subtraction:
~ health -= 25
Health is now {health}

Multiplication:
~ multiplier *= 3
Multiplier is now {multiplier}

Division:
~ price /= 4
Price is now {price}

Floor division:
~ count //= 2
Count is now {count}

Modulo:
~ health %= 10
Remainder is now {health}

Exponentiation:
~ multiplier **= 2
Multiplier is now {multiplier}
