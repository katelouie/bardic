**The Treasure Room**

You enter a dusty chamber. Three pedestals hold items:

* [Take the Sword of Light] -> GetSword
* [Take the Shield of Ages] -> GetShield
* [Take the Amulet of Power] -> GetAmulet
+ [Leave empty-handed] -> Leave

:: GetSword
~ has_sword = True

You grasp the gleaming sword. It feels right in your hands.

The pedestal sinks into the floor, sealing itself forever.

+ [Look at other items] -> Start

:: GetShield
~ has_shield = True

You strap on the ancient shield. It's lighter than it looks.

The pedestal crumbles to dust.

+ [Look at other items] -> Start

:: GetAmulet
~ has_amulet = True

You pocket the mysterious amulet. It pulses with energy.

The pedestal vanishes in a flash of light.
