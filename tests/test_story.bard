:: Start
You wake up in a mysterious room. The walls are bare stone, and a single door stands before you.

What do you do?

+ [Look around the room] -> LookAround
+ [Try to open the door] -> TryDoor

:: LookAround
You examine the room carefully. There's a small window high on the wall, but it's too dark outside to see anything. On the floor, you notice scratches, as if something heavy was dragged across it.

+ [Examine the scratches] -> ExamineScratches
+ [Try the door] -> TryDoor

:: ExamineScratches
The scratches lead to the corner of the room. Following them, you find a loose stone in the wall. Behind it, there's a rusty key!

+ [Take the key] -> TakeKey

:: TakeKey
You pocket the key. It feels cold and heavy in your hand.

+ [Try the door with the key] -> UnlockDoor
+ [Look around more] -> LookAround

:: TryDoor
You pull on the door handle. It's locked tight.

+ [Look around for a way out] -> LookAround

:: UnlockDoor
The key fits! With a loud click, the door swings open. Beyond it, you see sunlight and freedom.

You've escaped!
