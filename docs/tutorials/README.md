# The Bardic Guided Tour: From Writer to Python Magician

Welcome! This is the official tutorial series for Bardic, designed to take you from "Hello, World" to a fully-functioning, Python-powered interactive game.

## What's This All About?

You don't need to be a programmer to start, but Bardic's real magic comes from its "Python-first" design. This tutorial series is a single, linear path that gently introduces new concepts.

You'll start as a **Writer**, learning to create simple branching passages. Along the way, you'll become a **Technical Writer**, learning to add logic and memory to your story. By the end, you'll be a **Python Magician**, able to import your own custom classes and build complex narrative systems.

No matter your skill level, start at Part 1. Each lesson builds on the last.

## The Tutorial Series

- **Part 1: Your First Branching Story**
  - Learn the absolute basics. We'll create "pages" (passages), link them with choices (`+`), and play your first story in the terminal.

- **Part 2: Adding State & Memory**
  - Let's make your story remember things. We'll use variables (`~`), conditional logic (`<<if>>`), and one-time choices (`*`) to build a classic "locked door and key" puzzle.

- **Part 3: The Python-First Promise (The "Aha!" Moment)**
  - This is where Bardic shines. We'll go beyond simple variables to `import` your very own custom Python `Item` class. You'll build a real inventory, call methods on your objects, and see why Bardic is different from other tools.

- **Part 4: Building a "Game" with a Custom UI**
  - Let's break out of the terminal. You'll learn how to use the NiceGUI template, ask for the player's name with `@input`, and send game data to your UI with `@render`.

- **Part 5: Finishing & Polishing Your Story**
  - Your story is getting big! We'll cover the tools you need to manage a real project, like splitting your files with `@include` and debugging your plot with the `bardic graph` visualizer.
