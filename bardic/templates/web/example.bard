  description: A simple example story demonstrating Bardic features

:: Start
You stand before a mysterious door in an ancient hallway.

The door is made of dark wood, with strange symbols carved into its surface. A faint light glows from beneath it.

~ courage = 50
~ has_key = False

What will you do?

+ [Try to open the door] -> TryDoor
+ [Examine the symbols] -> ExamineSymbols
+ [Search the hallway] -> SearchHallway

:: TryDoor
You grasp the cold metal handle and pull.

<<if has_key>>
  The key from the hallway fits perfectly! The door swings open with a satisfying *click*.

  Beyond the threshold, you see a room filled with golden light...

  **You found the treasure!**

  *Courage: {courage}*
<<else>>
  The door is locked tight. You need to find a key.

  + [Examine the symbols] -> ExamineSymbols
  + [Search the hallway] -> SearchHallway
<<endif>>

:: ExamineSymbols
You lean closer to study the mysterious symbols carved into the wood.

<<python>>
courage = courage + 10
<<endpython>>

The symbols form a pattern - they seem to be instructions:

*"Seek what is hidden, and courage shall reward thee."*

Your **courage** increases to **{courage}** as you understand the meaning.

+ [Try to open the door] -> TryDoor
+ [Search the hallway] -> SearchHallway

:: SearchHallway
You carefully examine the hallway, running your hands along the stone walls.

<<python>>
courage = courage + 5
<<endpython>>

Behind a loose stone, you find something small and metallic...

**A key!**

~ has_key = True

Your courage grows to **{courage}** with this discovery.

+ [Try the key on the door] -> TryDoor
+ [Examine the symbols first] -> ExamineSymbols
